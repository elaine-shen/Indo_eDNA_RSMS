## Introduction

This Github page holds the code for processing environmental DNA sequences of water and sediment samples collected from three regions of Indonesia (Lombok, Misool, and Waigeo) between January 2018 - May 2019. These sequences are stored in the sequence read archive (SRA) under the [BioProject PRJNA1076664](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA1076664). Bioinformatic and statistical analyses have been split up into stepwise folders and contain both R code and command-line prompts. Details for each step are included in each folders’ README files. The bioinformatically-processed eDNA outputs (post OTU-clustering and taxonomic assignment) are available to directly upload for ecological and statistical analyses in step 5. All analyses were run locally for this project and will need modifications to suit your particular preferences for file organization.
